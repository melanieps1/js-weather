## MVP

Scope:
* App must display title, input box and submit button

* Upon clicking the submit button, must generate results (details below) if a valid zip code is entered

* When the submit button is clicked, that application must fetch weather data from api.openweathermap.org

* Results to generate and display for valid locations:
  1. City name
  2. Current conditions
  2. Current temperature in Kelvin, Fahrenheit and Celsius
  4. An image, selected by the current temperature

* If an invalid zip code is entered in the input box (if the request is unsuccessful), must display a friendly error state upon the user clicking the submit button
